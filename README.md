# IMPORTANT NOTICE

Jason Blevins, the author of Deft, is now on github, and has implemented both recursive directory listing and multiple file extensions in upstream Deft. This means that this fork is not necessary anymore!

Deft proper can be found at: https://github.com/jrblevin/deft

# deft-turbo

deft-turbo is a fork of the Emacs package Deft, originally by Jason
Blevins. See http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/

This fork is by [http://charlbotha.com/](Charl P. Botha)

## Additional features

### Recursive directory listing

The original Deft searches for files with `deft-extension` only in the
top-level `deft-directory`. deft-turbo searches recursively, so that
you can nest your files in arbitrarily deep subdirectories.

### Multiple file extensions

My notes database contains a mix of Markdown .md and Emacs org-mode
.org files. Instead of a single filename extension, deft-turbo allows
you to configure a list of valid extensions.

## Obtaining deft-turbo

You can clone this repo somewhere, and point emacs to it by adding ti
to the load-path.

Alternatively, you can use the following el-get recipe (thanks
https://github.com/stefanv ):

``` emacs-lisp
(setq el-get-sources
      '(
        (:name deft-turbo
         :description "Deft Turbo mode"
         :website "https://github.com/cpbotha/deft-turbo"
         :type github
         :pkgname "cpbotha/deft-turbo"
         :features deft
         :compile "deft.el")
))
```


## Configuration

Add the following to your `init.el`:

``` emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/where-you-put/deft")
(require 'deft)
(setq deft-extensions '("org" "md"))
(setq deft-default-extension "org")
(setq deft-directory "~/notes/")
(setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)
```
